Parking Management System in Assembly Language

Project Overview
This project implements a Parking Management System using x86 Assembly Language. It is designed to manage parking for three types of vehicles: Bikes, Cars, and Buses. 
The program displays a menu, allows the user to perform various actions like parking vehicles, showing parking records, and deleting records, and calculates the 
total parking fees.

The system is developed for an MS-DOS environment and uses INT 21h for I/O operations.

Usage Instructions

Assemble the code using an x86 assembler (e.g., MASM, TASM).
Run the executable in an MS-DOS environment or emulator (e.g., DOSBox).
